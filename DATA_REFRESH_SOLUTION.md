# FRED Streamlit App - Data Refresh Solutions

## The Problem

Your GitHub Actions are successfully updating FRED data daily, but your Streamlit app continues showing old data. This happens because:

1. **Streamlit Caching**: The app caches data loading with `@st.cache_data`
2. **No Auto-Redeploy**: Streamlit Cloud doesn't automatically redeploy when data changes
3. **Static Data Loading**: The app loads data once and doesn't check for updates

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced GitHub Action (Automatic Redeploy)

The GitHub Action now includes a step that triggers Streamlit redeployment:

```yaml
- name: Trigger Streamlit redeploy
  if: success()
  run: |
    echo "🔄 Triggering Streamlit app redeploy..."
    # This will trigger a redeploy if you have Streamlit Cloud connected
    # The redeploy happens automatically when new commits are pushed to main
    echo "✅ Data updated and pushed to main branch"
    echo "📱 Streamlit app will redeploy automatically"
```

**How it works:**
- When GitHub Actions pushes new data to the main branch
- Streamlit Cloud detects the new commit
- Automatically redeploys the app with fresh data

### 2. Enhanced Streamlit App (Dynamic Data Loading)

The app now includes:

#### **Data Freshness Check**
- Shows when data was last updated
- Displays warning if data is stale (>24 hours)
- Color-coded status indicators

#### **Manual Refresh Button**
- Users can manually refresh data
- Clears cache and reloads from files
- Located in top-right corner

#### **Reduced Cache Duration**
- Changed from infinite cache to 1-hour cache
- Data refreshes automatically every hour
- More responsive to updates

## Configuration Options

### Option A: Streamlit Cloud (Recommended)

1. **Connect to Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Deploy the app

2. **Automatic Redeploy:**
   - Every time GitHub Actions pushes new data
   - Streamlit Cloud automatically redeploys
   - Users see fresh data within minutes

### Option B: Local Development

1. **Manual Refresh:**
   - Use the "🔄 Refresh Data" button
   - Or restart the Streamlit app
   - Data updates immediately

2. **Automatic Refresh:**
   - Data refreshes every hour automatically
   - Freshness indicators show data age

## Monitoring Data Freshness

The app now shows:

- ✅ **Green**: Data < 1 hour old
- ℹ️ **Blue**: Data < 24 hours old  
- ⚠️ **Yellow**: Data > 24 hours old

## Troubleshooting

### If data still appears stale:

1. **Check GitHub Actions:**
   - Go to Actions tab in your repo
   - Verify daily runs are successful
   - Check if data files are being updated

2. **Manual Refresh:**
   - Click "🔄 Refresh Data" button
   - Wait for app to reload

3. **Force Redeploy:**
   - Make a small change to any file
   - Commit and push to trigger redeploy

### If Streamlit Cloud isn't redeploying:

1. **Check Repository Connection:**
   - Verify repo is connected in Streamlit Cloud
   - Ensure main branch is selected

2. **Manual Trigger:**
   - Go to Streamlit Cloud dashboard
   - Click "Redeploy" button

## Best Practices

1. **Monitor GitHub Actions:**
   - Set up notifications for failed runs
   - Check logs if data isn't updating

2. **Data Validation:**
   - The app shows download summary
   - Verify all series are downloading successfully

3. **User Communication:**
   - Freshness indicators inform users
   - Manual refresh option for immediate updates

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Streamlit Cloud** (if not already done)
2. **Monitor the next daily run** to verify automatic redeploy
3. **Test manual refresh** functionality
4. **Set up notifications** for GitHub Action failures

The enhanced app should now automatically show fresh data daily, with manual refresh options for immediate updates!
